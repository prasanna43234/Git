10. git merge
    - Explanation: Merges the changes from one branch into the current branch.

### Advanced Commands

15. git rebase
    - Explanation: Reapplies commits from the current branch onto another branch.
    - Example:
      git rebase master

16. git reset
    - Explanation: Resets the current HEAD to a specified state, optionally modifying the working directory and staging area.
    - Example:
      git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Reset to the previous commit
      git reset HEAD file.txt  # Unstage a file

17. git cherry-pick
    - Explanation: Applies the changes from a specific commit to the current branch.
    - Example:
      git cherry-pick commit-id

18. git stash
    - Explanation: Temporarily saves uncommitted changes and reverts the working directory to the last commit.
    - Example:
      git stash
      git stash pop  # Retrieve the stashed changes

19. git tag

21. git log --graph
    - Explanation: Displays the commit history in a graphical format, showing the branch structure.
    - Example:
      git log --graph --oneline --all

22. git bisect
    - Explanation: Helps to find the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search.
    - Example:

      git bisect bad commit-id   # Mark a known bad commit

23. git reflog
    - Explanation: Shows the history of HEAD and other references, useful for recovering lost commits.
    - Example:
