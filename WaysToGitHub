Git Commands: From Basic to Advanced

---

1. Using HTTPS

- What it is:  
  HTTPS uses your GitHub account's username and a personal access token (or password) for authentication.

- Steps:  
  1. Clone a repository:  
     git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git  
  2. When prompted, enter your username and personal access token.  

- Advantages:  
  - Easy to set up and use.  
  - Works through firewalls and proxies.  

- Disadvantages:  
  - Requires entering credentials frequently unless you cache them.  

- Caching Credentials:  
  To avoid entering credentials repeatedly, you can cache them:  
  git config --global credential.helper cache  

---

2. Using SSH

- What it is:  
  SSH uses public-private key pairs for secure authentication without requiring your GitHub credentials each time.

- Steps:  
  1. Generate an SSH key:  
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"  
     (For older systems: use rsa instead of ed25519.)  
  2. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:  
     - Copy the public key:  
       cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  
     - Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG Keys → New SSH Key.  
     - Paste the public key and save.  
  3. Clone a repository:  
     git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git  

- Advantages:  
  - No need to repeatedly enter credentials.  
  - More secure than HTTPS.  

- Disadvantages:  
  - Initial setup is slightly more complex.

3. Using GitHub CLI (gh)

- What it is:  
  The GitHub CLI (gh) is a command-line tool that simplifies GitHub operations, including authentication.

- Steps:  
  1. Install GitHub CLI:  
     Follow instructions from https://cli.github.com/.  
  2. Authenticate:  
     gh auth login  
     Choose HTTPS or SSH during the setup process.  
  3. Clone a repository:  
     gh repo clone username/repository  

- Advantages:  
  - Easy authentication and management of GitHub resources.  
  - Supports additional features like creating issues, pull requests, and releases.  

- Disadvantages:  
  - Requires installing and learning the CLI tool.

4. Using a PAT (Personal Access Token)

- What it is:  
  Personal Access Tokens are used instead of passwords for HTTPS-based connections. This is necessary since GitHub deprecated password authentication for Git operations.

- Steps:  
  1. Generate a PAT:  
     - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Tokens (Classic) → Generate new token.  
     - Select scopes (permissions) as needed and generate.  
  2. Use the PAT:  
     Replace your password with the PAT when prompted:  
     git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git  

- Advantages:  
  - Works like a password but more secure.  

- Disadvantages:  
  - Requires managing and securely storing the PAT.  

---

5. Using OAuth for Third-Party Applications

- What it is:  
  OAuth tokens allow GitHub access via third-party apps (e.g., VSCode, GitHub Desktop) without directly using your credentials.

- Steps:  
  - Log in to GitHub within the application.  
  - Grant necessary permissions to the app.  

- Advantages:  
  - Simplifies integration with external tools.  

- Disadvantages:  
  - Limited to app-specific use.  

---

6. Using GitHub Desktop

- What it is:  
  GitHub Desktop is a graphical user interface for GitHub, designed to simplify version control operations.

- Steps:  
  1. Install GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/.  
  2. Log in using your GitHub account.  
  3. Clone, commit, and push repositories using the app.  

- Advantages:  
  - User-friendly interface.  
  - No command-line experience needed.  

- Disadvantages:  
  - Limited flexibility compared to CLI.  

---

Choosing the Right Method:

- Use HTTPS if you want a quick setup and work across various networks.  
- Use SSH if you prefer a more secure and credential-free experience after setup.  
- Use GitHub CLI for integrated GitHub workflows.  
- Use GitHub Desktop or OAuth for GUI-based operations or app-specific needs.  
- Use PAT if you're required to authenticate for specific use cases like CI/CD.
